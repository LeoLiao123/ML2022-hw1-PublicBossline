## Introdution
This project focuses on COVID-19 case prediction using a deep neural network (DNN) for regression analysis. Built with PyTorch, it includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and train/validation split. The model is a multi-layer neural network with fully connected layers, activation functions, and dropout regularization. Training involves an adaptive learning rate scheduler and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
